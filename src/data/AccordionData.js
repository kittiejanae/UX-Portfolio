    question: "About Me",
    answer:
      "I have been a trainer and a mentor. I am efficient and proficient at process improvement (enjoy working smarter). I have been known to create and write procedures, be reliable and handle short deadlines with a healthy sense of urgency. \n I recently graduated from Kenzie Academy’s UX Program and am the perfect candidate to train, learn and grow with your company. I have built front-end websites and apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I'm also currently learning more about mainframes. \n My wide ranging experience makes me an invaluable asset to any team. I am detail-oriented, empathetic, always looking for ways to refine solutions, and I never give up. These are all qualities of a great designer. My 10+ years in customer service matched with the various projects that I've completed over the years (apps, websites, blogs, graphic design, audio, film, podcasts, vlogs, etc) allows me to work well with clients and deliver high-quality products.",

    question: "What bought me to UX/UI?",
    answer:
      "I’ve always loved the idea of refining things in a creative way. When I was an Assistant Manager at Stone Mountain Park, I found their processing of training new employees was causing a high overturn rate of those same employees that our department needed. I ended up re-writing the training manual and bringing it to my manager. A week later I was the Training Manager and my plan was being implemented! \n It was such a great feeling to watch our employees become happier, stay longer and the park’s guests were happier as a result. Our department even started making more money. \n I loved that feeling. Figuring out the true issue and being a part of making the outcome better for everyone is truly a gift. That’s why and when I fell in love with UX. \n My experience in customer service, interest in psychology, creative nature, and hunger for knowledge turned out to be the perfect storm for my decision to enter the UX field.",

    question: "How does my background make me a better UX designer?",
    answer:
      "I am always interested to learn more and being exposed to such a diverse environment will, no doubt, inspire my ideas about solving problems in innovative ways. \n My experience as a TV Host will make me an asset when communicating with and presenting to clients from any background. Also, my love of research will serve to ensure the team can work as effectively as possible. \n Finally, being in customer service jobs majority of my life has taught me that every job is a customer service job. Leading with empathy in the face of adversity is such a huge job for such a small title. I always put people first, as any  great UX Designer should.",

    question: " My Greatest Strength & My Greatest Weakness",
    answer:
      "My greatest strength is that I can thrive in any environment. I can work on a team, work solo, fast-paced, in sprints, I can do it all. \n I’m also not a person who gives up easily. When given feedback, I do my best to apply it to the project or to correct those behaviors, if needed. \n My weakness would be that, sometimes, I am over zealous in my search for efficiency. I want things to make sense and run smoothly all the time. That’s just not possible. In my younger years, this would frustrate me but now I am open to things going differently because that’s where innovation lives. I may need to remind myself that sometimes but, being aware of it has helped me practice empathy towards myself too!",
